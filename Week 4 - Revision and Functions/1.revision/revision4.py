##this function will add up the first N natural numbers:
def sumFirstNumbers(N):
    mySum = #assign this a suitable value
    for i in range(, ): #what should the values of range be
        mySum += #finish this statement
    return #what do I want to return?

sum100 = sumFirstNumbers( ) #fill in the function to add up the first 100 numbers
#print the value of sum100 - is it 5050 like before?

#now create a variable sum50 - do as above and print its value

#this function won't return anything - it is used to
#run the same procedure with different inputs
#however it will still print a result
def greeting():
    input(" ") #get the user's name and assign it to a variable userName
                #print a message to the user with their name


greeting()
