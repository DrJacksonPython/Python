#for myNumbers in range(1, 11):      this will print the numbers 1 to 10
#    print(myNumbers)

#
#I suggest doing these one at a time - running, check you've got it right and move on to the next one!
#


#use the above to print the numbers from 1 to 5


#use the above to print the even numbers from 1 to 10


#create a variable myName and assign a string with your name
#use a for loop to print each letter of your name


mySum = 0
#use a for loop to add the numbers 1 to 100 to the variable mySum
#you will need the following - if x = 2 and y= 7, then x +=y will make x = 9
#it is the same as x = x + y

#print mySum - it should be 5050

#create a new variable myEvenSum and assign it the value 0
#do the same as above but for even numbers from 1 to 100 - what do you get now?
