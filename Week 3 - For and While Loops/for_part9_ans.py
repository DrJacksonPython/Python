# use a while loop to print the numbers from 1 to 10
# DO NOT RUN AN INFINITE LOOP!!!!!!!
i = 1
while i < 11:#fill this in to keep the loop running only to print the values from 1 to 10
    print(i)#print the value of i
    i += 1#what do you need to add to i here? if this wasn't here, what would happen to the loop?
