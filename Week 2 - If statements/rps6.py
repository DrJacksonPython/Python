#we're going to use nested if statements to do the last part:
#the first if statement is entered if the condition is true
#then subsequent if statements are checked.
#It is like a door that opens to a choice of doors.

#This code first checks if a number is greater than 100
#Then, if it is, it will check if it is odd or even.
#Remove the # (highlight the code below and hit alt+4, paste the code below into
#a test file with different x values, try to see
#what is happening for yourself

##x = 98
##if x > 100:
##    if x % 2 == 0:
##        print("your number is even")
##    elif x % 2 == 1:
##        print("your number is odd")

    
#copy the stuff from part 5 here

#write an if statement to check if the user chose PAPER

#now nest your if statements - what happens if the computer chooses ROCK or SCISSORS
