#copy the stuff from part 2 here 

#at this point, you have two variables
# user_choice holds ROCK, PAPER or SCISSORS for the user
# com_choice holds ROCK, PAPER or SCISSORS for the computer

if : #check if the user's choice and computer choice are the same
     #tell the user its a draw


#run your code a few times - if user choice and computer choice are the same, your code should print the result
#if they are different, nothing should happen!
