#copy the stuff from rps3 here

#you can write this bit two different ways: we'll do it one way in this part
#and use nested if statements in the last part

if user_choice == "ROCK" and : #check if the user chooses ROCK _and_ computer chooses SCISSORS
     print() #tell the user who won
elif :                      #check if the user chooses ROCK _and_ computer chooses PAPER
     #tell the user who won

#run your code a few times
#choose ROCK in each case and see what happens - is it doing what you expect?
#choose PAPER a couple of times, what do you expect to happen?
